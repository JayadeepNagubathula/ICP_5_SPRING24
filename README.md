Hello All,

   In this repository i have analyzed navie bayes algorithm and linear svm algorithm for the same given data. please do check the document for the results with accuracy score. 
   Navie Bayes have more accuracy because ir requires less training data and less expensive compares to linear SVM algorithm.
